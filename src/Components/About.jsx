          Hey, Iâ€™m Tanay! Iâ€™m a computer science student diving into low-level programming with Rust, and Iâ€™m pretty comfortable working with Linux systems. Lately, Iâ€™ve been learning AI with the goal of blending it into low-level systems to create smarter, more efficient solutions. I love building optimized systems that connect hardware and software.<br />
          When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me blogging random thoughts on Mediumâ€”definitely check it out! Iâ€™m also a huge football fan (Chelsea is ðŸ’™) and love traveling to new places, sharing my adventures along the way.<br/> My dream is to bridge the gap between computers and human intelligence by creating systems that can learn and adapt to user needs. Iâ€™m also super interested in how technology can tackle real-world problems and make a positive impact on society.
